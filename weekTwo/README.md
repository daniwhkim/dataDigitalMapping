# Week Two

Assignment: Create a map using preexisting data.<br/>

With recent events in mind, I wanted to point out all the international airports in the United States to visualize how prevalent international travels, affairs, and relations is to this country. I plan to further iterate on this map by adding polylines between all the airports, mirroring the act of "connecting the dots", to illustrate that a perimetering wall is not possible to separate this country from its bordering nations.<br/>
