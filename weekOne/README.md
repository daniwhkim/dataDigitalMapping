# Week One

Assignment: Create a map using Leaflet.js, while loading tiles from Stamen or CartoDB.<br/>

Four times every year, I fly across the globe to visit my parents in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Manila, The Philippines. I take a very specific route to get there and back because of my loyalty to Emirates Airlines and my love for Dubai, United Arab Emirates.<br/>
