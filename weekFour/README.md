# Week Four

Assignment: Use Mapbox Studio or Mapzen's Tangram to create a new basemap style and map some data from NYC's Open Data Portal. And use QGIS to create a map of the physical features of some country in the world. Get data from Natural Earth Data.<br/>

While browsing NYC's Open Data Portal, I found a dataset that documented landmarks in Union Square, New York City. Oddly, the CSV file only had three entries but I found this appropriate to map using Tangram because the zoom level could be set higher to show emphasis on the map's 3D qualities. To customize the map to look like it does, I pulled in a Tangram basemap from Mapzen and added <i>scene</i> properties to it using a YAML document. This file organizes and styles the elements Tangram uses to draw the map, such as cameras, lights, textures, and styles.
